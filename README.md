Many UK broadcasters and producers have been affected by the rise of streaming platforms. However, they are far from irrelevant. In 2020, a BBC production called ‘The Fall’ that had aired on live TV in 2013 premiered on Netflix UK. It was the most-viewed programme of the quarter. This means that broadcasters are sitting on a mountain of content, some of which could be revived and enjoyed by new generations if it were distributed via streaming platform. 
The key questions are:
1)	How do we classify an SVOD hit? Linear TV has been around for ages, so we already know when something has done well. But with SVOD? How do we tell?
2)	What are the attributes of a programme or movie that mean that it is likely to perform well on SVOD? How can we start to sieve through the broadcaster catalogue and choose which programmes could perform well on a streaming platform?
